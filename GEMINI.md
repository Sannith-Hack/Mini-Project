Project 1: Smart Classroom Attendance using Face Detection

Context:
In traditional classrooms, attendance is taken manually which consumes time and may lead to proxy attendance. This project proposes an automated attendance system using face recognition technology. A camera captures student faces and matches them with stored records to mark attendance automatically.

Focus:
Time saving
Accuracy
No proxy attendance
Automation in education

--------------------------------------------------

Project 2: Smart Crop Watering Advisor for Farmers

Context:
Farmers often struggle to decide when and how much to water their crops. Overwatering wastes water and harms plants, while underwatering affects crop growth. This project helps farmers by analyzing soil moisture and weather conditions to recommend the right time for irrigation.

Focus:
Water conservation
Better crop yield
Support for small farmers
Simple decision-making

--------------------------------------------------

Project 3: Smart Medicine Reminder & Health Tracker

Context:
Many elderly people and patients forget to take medicines on time. Missing doses can lead to serious health problems. This project provides a smart reminder system that alerts users to take medicines and keeps track of their medication schedule.

Focus:
Patient safety
Timely medication
Support for elderly
Health monitoring

--------------------------------------------------

Project 4: Custom Windows ISO for B.Tech Studies

Context:
Installing standard Windows requires students to manually download and install multiple programming tools and software (Python, Java, MS Office, WSL), which is time-consuming. This project involves creating a customized Windows ISO that comes pre-installed with all necessary B.Tech software, allowing for a single-step setup.

Focus:
Efficiency
Standardization
One-click setup
Time saving for students
