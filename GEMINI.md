Project 1: Smart Classroom Attendance using Face Detection

Context:
In traditional classrooms, attendance is taken manually which consumes time and may lead to proxy attendance. This project proposes an automated attendance system using face recognition technology. A camera captures student faces and matches them with stored records to mark attendance automatically.

Focus:
Time saving
Accuracy
No proxy attendance
Automation in education

Project 2: Smart Crop Watering Advisor for Farmers

Context:
Farmers often struggle to decide when and how much to water their crops. Overwatering wastes water and harms plants, while underwatering affects crop growth. This project helps farmers by analyzing soil moisture and weather conditions to recommend the right time for irrigation.

Focus:
Water conservation
Better crop yield
Support for small farmers
Simple decision-making

Project 3: Smart Medicine Reminder & Health Tracker

Context:
Many elderly people and patients forget to take medicines on time. Missing doses can lead to serious health problems. This project provides a smart reminder system that alerts users to take medicines and keeps track of their medication schedule.

Focus:
Patient safety
Timely medication
Support for elderly
Health monitoring
